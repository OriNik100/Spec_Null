# Spec_Null
This is the Repository for our project, which involves developing a new transmitting/receiving method to integrate sensing and communication (ISAC), via spectral nulling a chirp signal by adding time-varying phase, and embedding an OFDM signal within the nulled frequencies.
We train a neural network to find the optimal phase, which will nullify the chirp spectrum but also minimaly modify the chirp's overall shape.
